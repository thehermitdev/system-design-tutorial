# **Database Sharding - System Design**

Database sharding is a technique used to scale databases by distributing data across multiple servers. It helps improve performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

- Data is split into smaller parts called shards, each stored on a different database instance to distribute load.
- It reduces pressure on a single database, improving query performance and scalability.

It is basically a database architecture pattern in which we split a large dataset into smaller chunks (logical shards) and we store/distribute these chunks in different machines/database nodes (physical shards).

- Each chunk/partition is known as a "shard" and each shard has the same database schema as the original database.
- We distribute the data in such a way that each row appears in exactly one shard.
- It's a good mechanism to improve the scalability of an application.

## **Methods of Sharding**

Sharding can be done using Range-based, Hash-based, Directory-based, or Geographic-based partitioning to distribute data across multiple servers.

### **1. Key Based Sharding**

Key Based Sharding is a technique, also known as hash-based sharding. Here, we take the value of an entity such as customer ID, customer email, IP address of a client, zip code, etc and we use this value as an input of the hash function. This process generates a hash value which is used to determine which shard we need to use to store the data.

- We need to keep in mind that the values entered into the hash function should all come from the **same column** (shard key) just to ensure that data is placed in the correct order and in a consistent manner.
- Basically, shard keys act like a primary key or a unique identifier for individual rows.

> ***Example**: You have 3 database servers and each request has an application id which is incremented by 1 every time a new application is registered.*

To determine which server data should be placed on, we perform a modulo operation on these applications id with the number 3. Then the remainder is used to identify the server to store our data.

#### **Advantages**

Key-based sharding helps distribute data across shards using a hashing mechanism.

- **Key Assignment:** Assigns each key to a specific shard, ensuring uniform and consistent data distribution.
- **Range Query Optimization:** Can be optimized to efficiently handle queries over consecutive key ranges.

#### **Disadvantages**

Despite its efficiency, improper shard key selection can cause performance issues.

- **Uneven Data Distribution:** Can occur if the sharding key isn’t well-distributed.
- **Scalability Limitation:** Scalability may be limited when certain keys receive heavy traffic or data is skewed.

### **2. Horizontal or Range Based Sharding**

In Horizontal or Range Based Sharding, we divide the data by separating it into different parts based on the range of a specific value within each record. Let's say you have a database of your online customers' names and email information. You can split this information into two shards.

- In one shard you can keep the info of customers whose first name starts with A-P.
- In another shard, keep the information of the rest of the customers.

> **Example**: In a customer database, one shard may store records where names start with A–P, while another shard stores records where names start with Q–Z.

#### **Advantages**

Horizontal or range-based sharding distributes data across multiple shards based on specific value ranges.

- **Scalability:** Horizontal or range-based sharding allows for seamless scalability by distributing data across multiple shards, accommodating growing datasets.
- **Improved Performance:** Data distribution among shards enhances query performance through parallelization, ensuring faster operations with smaller subsets of data handled by each shard.

#### **Disadvantages**

Managing and querying data across multiple shards can introduce additional complexity.

- **Complex Querying Across Shards:** Coordinating queries involving multiple shards can be challenging.
- **Uneven Data Distribution:** Poorly managed data distribution may lead to uneven workloads among shards.

### **3. Vertical Sharding**

Vertical sharding divides a database by separating columns of a table into different shards or tables. Each shard stores a specific set of columns related to a particular feature or functionality. This helps distribute workload and manage large tables more efficiently.

- Each shard contains a subset of columns while rows remain logically related to the same entity.
- Different features of an entity can be stored on separate machines to improve performance and manageability.

> ***Example**: On Twitter users might have a profile, number of followers, and some tweets posted by his/her own. We can place the user profiles on one shard, followers in the second shard, and tweets on a third shard.*

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20260114163511692882/vertical_sharding-660.webp" alt="vertical_sharding" />

#### **Advantages**

Vertical sharding divides a database by separating columns into different shards based on functionality.

- **Query Performance:** Vertical sharding can improve query performance by allowing each shard to focus on a specific subset of columns. This specialization enhances the efficiency of queries that involve only a subset of the available columns.
- **Simplified Queries:** Queries that require a specific set of columns can be simplified, as they only need to interact with the shard containing the relevant columns.

#### **Disadvantages**

Splitting columns across shards can introduce operational and workload challenges.

- **Potential for Hotspots:** Certain shards may become hotspots if they contain highly accessed columns, leading to uneven distribution of workloads.
- **Challenges in Schema Changes:** Making changes to the schema, such as adding or removing columns, may be more challenging in a vertically sharded system. Changes can impact multiple shards and require careful coordination.

### **4. Directory-Based Sharding**

In Directory-Based Sharding, we create and maintain a lookup service or lookup table for the original database. Basically we use a shard key for lookup table and we do mapping for each entity that exists in the database. This way we keep track of which database shards hold which data.

> ***Example**: A user database may use a lookup table that maps each user ID to the specific shard where that user’s data is stored. When a request is made, the system first checks the lookup table and then routes the query to the correct shard.*

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20260114163511883644/pre_sharded_table-660.webp" alt="pre_sharded_table" />

The lookup table holds a static set of information about where specific data can be found.

In the above image, you can see that we have used the delivery zone as a shard key:

- Firstly the client application queries the lookup service to find out the shard (database partition) on which the data is placed.
- When the lookup service returns the shard it queries/updates that shard.

#### **Advantages**

Directory-based sharding uses a central lookup service that keeps track of where each piece of data is stored.

- **Flexible Data Distribution:** Directory-based sharding allows for flexible data distribution, where the central directory can dynamically manage and update the mapping of data to shard locations.
- **Efficient Query Routing:** Queries can be efficiently routed to the appropriate shard using the information stored in the directory. This results in improved query performance.
- **Dynamic Scalability:** The system can dynamically scale by adding or removing shards without requiring changes to the application logic.

#### **Disadvantages**

While flexible, this approach introduces dependency on the central directory.

- **Centralized Point of Failure:** The central directory represents a single point of failure. If the directory becomes unavailable or experiences issues, it can disrupt the entire system, impacting data access and query routing.
- **Increased Latency:** Query routing through a central directory introduces an additional layer, potentially leading to increased latency compared to other sharding strategies.

## **Ways to optimize database sharding for even data distribution**

Here are some simple ways to optimize database sharding for even data distribution:

- **Use Consistent Hashing**: This helps distribute data more evenly across all shards by using a hashing function that assigns records to different shards based on their key values.
- **Choose a Good Sharding Key**: Picking a well-balanced sharding key is crucial. A key that doesn’t create hotspots ensures that data spreads out evenly across all servers.
- **Range-Based Sharding with Caution**: If using range-based sharding, make sure the ranges are properly defined so that one shard doesn’t get overloaded with more data than others.
- **Regularly Monitor and Rebalance**: Keep an eye on data distribution and rebalance shards when necessary to avoid uneven loads as data grows.
- **Automate Sharding Logic**: Implement automation tools or built-in database features that automatically distribute data and handle sharding to maintain balance across shards.

## **Alternatives to database sharding**

Below are some of the alternatives to database sharding:

1. **Vertical Scaling**: [**Vertical Scaling**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/system-design-horizontal-and-vertical-scaling/) means upgrading the same server by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to handle more load, but it has a fixed hardware limit so it can’t scale forever.
2. **Replication**: [**Replication**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/database-replication-and-their-types-in-system-design/) means creating database copies on multiple servers for load balancing and high availability, but replicas may face synchronization issues.
3. **Partitioning**: [**Partitioning**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/data-partitioning-techniques/) means splitting data into smaller parts within the same server to improve performance for large datasets without using multiple servers.
4. **Caching**: [**Caching**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/caching-system-design-concept-for-beginners/) means storing frequently used data in Redis/Memcached to reduce database load and speed up responses.
5. **CDNs**: [**CDNs**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/what-is-content-delivery-networkcdn-in-system-design/) mean using a Content Delivery Network for read-heavy data to reduce direct database access and deliver content faster.
