# **SQL Vs NoSQL Databases in System Design**

When designing a system, one of the most critical decisions is choosing between SQL and NoSQL databases. This choice can significantly impact the system’s performance, scalability, and overall success.

- SQL databases use structured schemas with tables and support strong consistency, making them ideal for complex queries and reliable transactions.
- NoSQL databases use flexible schemas and are designed for high scalability, making them suitable for large-scale and unstructured data.

## **SQL Database**

SQL databases are relational systems that store structured data in tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL for data management and support strong consistency. These databases are ideal for applications requiring complex queries and reliable transactions.

### **Characteristics**

SQL databases follow a structured approach to store and manage data efficiently.

- **Tabular Data Model:** SQL databases organize records into tables with rows and columns.
- **Fixed Schema:** SQL databases require a predefined schema, which means that you must define the structure of the records, specifying record types and relationships earlier than adding records to the database.
- **ACID Compliance:** SQL databases are commonly ACID-compliant, which means they ensure data consistency and integrity and integrity via Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
- **Structured Query Language (SQL):** SQL databases use a standardized query language to control and retrieve data. SQL is strong and supports complex queries, making it suitable for applications requiring statistical analytics and reporting.

### **Example**

Common SQL databases widely used in real-world applications.

- **MySQL:** An open-source relational database widely used in various applications.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database known for its extensibility and support for advanced features.

### **Applications**

SQL databases are commonly used in systems requiring structured data and strong consistency.

- **E-commerce / Financial Systems / CMS :** Managing structured data, relationships, and ensuring transactional integrity and use SQL.
- **Banking & Inventory Management :** Ensures accuracy when transferring funds or updating inventory.

## **NoSQL Database**

NoSQL databases are designed to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data. They provide high flexibility, scalability, and performance, making them suitable for modern applications that handle large and rapidly changing datasets.

### **Characteristics**

NoSQL databases are designed to handle flexible, scalable, and distributed data efficiently.

- **Flexible Data Model:** NoSQL databases support different types of data storage, such as key-value, document, column, and graph formats.
- **Schema-less:** NoSQL databases are schema-less, this means data can be inserted without a predefined schema.
- **BASE (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent):** Instead of ACID compliance, NoSQL databases frequently follow the BASE model. BASE prioritizes high availability and performance over strict consistency.
- **Proprietary Query Language:** NoSQL databases typically have their own query languages tailored to their specific data models. These query languages are often simpler and better suited to the data structure.

### **Example**

Popular NoSQL databases used in modern applications.

- **MongoDB:** A popular document store that offers flexibility and scalability.
- **Cassandra:** A wide-column store designed to handle large amounts of data and support high write speeds.

### **Applications**

NoSQL databases are commonly used in systems requiring scalability and handling unstructured data.

- **Social Media & Big Data Platforms :** Handling unstructured user-generated content at scale. Code submissions on GeeksforGeeks Practice.
- **Real-Time Analytics, IoT Applications :** High write volume, schema flexibility, and the need for fast access.

## **Situations Where SQL Databases Are a Better Choice**

SQL databases are appropriate for situations such as:

- **Complex Queries:** If your application requires advanced queries and complex reporting, SQL databases excel in this area because of their structured schema and SQL query language.
- **Data Integrity:** When data consistency and integrity are paramount, particularly in financial or regulatory applications, SQL databases with ACID compliance are the desired preference.
- **Transactions:** SQL databases are the go-to option for applications that require support for multi-step, ACID-compliant transactions, like e-commerce systems.

## **Situations Where NoSQL Databases Are a Better Choice**

NoSQL databases perform better in certain situations:

- **High Scalability:** If your system needs to handle large amounts of data and traffic, NoSQL databases provide horizontal scalability, making them a top desire for net and mobile programs.
- **Flexible Schema:** When your data structure is dynamic and may evolve through the years, NoSQL databases with schema-less designs allow easier changes and updates.
- **Real-time Analytics:** NoSQL databases are often preferred for real-time analytics because of their speed and flexibility.

## **Differences between SQL and NoSQL**

Below are the important differences between SQL and NoSQL:

| **SQL Databases** | **NoSQL Databases** |
| --- | --- |
| Use a relational data model with tables consisting of rows and columns. | Use non-relational models such as document, key-value, column-family, or graph. |
| Require a fixed and predefined schema before storing data. | Follow a schema-less or flexible schema approach. |
| Best suited for structured data with clear relationships. | Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data. |
| Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and query data. | Use database-specific query languages or APIs. |
| Usually scale vertically by increasing resources on a single server. | Designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers. |
| Follow ACID properties for strong consistency and reliable transactions. | Often follow the BASE model focusing on availability and eventual consistency. |
| Handle complex relationships using joins and keys. | Relationships are usually handled at the application level. |
| Less flexible when schema changes are required. | Highly flexible because schema can change easily. |
| Ideal for complex queries and transactional systems. | Optimized for large-scale data and high-speed operations. |
| Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. | Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. |
