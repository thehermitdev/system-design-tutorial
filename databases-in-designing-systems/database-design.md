# **Database Design - System Design**

Database design is the process of organizing and structuring data so it can be stored, accessed, and managed efficiently. It plays a key role in building fast and reliable systems by improving performance, ensuring data consistency, and supporting scalability. A well-designed database meets application requirements while maintaining efficiency and reliability.

- Helps organize data efficiently, enabling fast data retrieval and improving overall system performance and responsiveness.
- Maintains data consistency and reliability, while ensuring the system can scale effectively as data and user demand grow.

> ***Example:** An e-commerce website designs its database with separate tables for users, products, and orders so that product searches, user data, and order processing can be handled efficiently.*

## **Database**

A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed so that it can be easily accessed, updated, and retrieved when needed.

- A database helps store large amounts of data in a structured and efficient way. It’s used in various applications, from websites and mobile apps to enterprise systems.
- Think of it as a digital filing cabinet where information is systematically arranged to make it easy to find and use.

### **Terminologies used in the Database**

These are some basic terms commonly used in database systems to understand how data is stored and managed.

- **Data:** Any statistics which is raw and unprocessed are referred as Data.
- **Information:** When data is processed, it is known as Information. This is because information gives an idea about what the data is about and how to use it further
- **Database Management System(DBMS):** A system developed to add, edit, and manage various databases in a collection is known as DBMS.
- **Transactions**: A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations (like CRUD) executed as a single unit of work.

## **Types of Databases**

Databases are categorized based on their data models, structure, and use cases in system design.

### **1. Relational Databases(SQL)**

Relational databases store structured data in a well-organized tabular format.

- Organize data into tables (rows and columns), where each table has a predefined structure.
- Tables can have relationships with one another using keys (e.g., primary and foreign keys).
- **Example:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database.
- Best for structured data like financial systems or inventory management.

### **2. Non-Relational Databases(NoSQL)**

Non-relational databases store data in flexible formats and are designed for scalability.

- Do not use tables. Instead, they store data in flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns.
- Designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts or IoT data.
- **Example:** MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB.
- Ideal for applications that require high scalability and flexibility.

## **Importance**

Good database design is important in system design because it ensures that the system can handle data efficiently, reliably, and at scale. Let us see its importance:

- **Performance**: A well-designed database processes data quickly, which means faster responses for users and smoother system operations.
- **Scalability**: As the system grows, a good database design can handle more users and data without slowing down or failing.
- **Data Integrity**: Proper design prevents duplicate, inconsistent, or incorrect data, ensuring the system works accurately.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: A clean, logical database structure is easier to understand and update, saving time and effort when making changes or fixing issues.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Optimized database designs use resources efficiently, reducing server costs and improving overall system performance.

## **Relational(SQL) Vs Non-Relational Databases(NoSQL)**

| **Relational Database (SQL)** | **Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)** |
| --- | --- |
| Uses tables with rows and columns to store structured data. | Stores data in flexible formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or columns. |
| Requires a fixed schema where the structure must be defined before storing data. | Uses schema-less or flexible schema, allowing changes in data structure easily. |
| Supports complex relationships between tables using joins and foreign keys. | Designed for minimal or no relationships between data entities. |
| Usually scales vertically by increasing CPU, RAM, or storage of a single server. | Scales horizontally by adding multiple servers or nodes. |
| Best suited for structured data and applications requiring complex queries and transactions. | Best suited for large-scale, unstructured, or semi-structured data with high scalability needs. |

## **CAP Theorem In Database Designing**

[CAP Theorem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/cap-theorem-in-system-design/) states that it is not possible to guarantee all three of the desirable properties – [consistency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/consistency-in-system-design/), [availability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/availability-in-system-design/), and partition tolerance at the same time in a [distributed system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-a-distributed-system/) with data replication.

### **1. CP database**

A CP database prioritizes Consistency and Partition Tolerance from the CAP theorem. This means:

- **Consistency**: All users see the same data, even after updates. If one user updates the database, everyone else will see the updated value immediately.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The database continues to work even if there is a network failure or a part of the system is unreachable.

However, it sacrifices Availability, meaning the system might not respond during network issues to maintain data accuracy.

> ***Example:** Banking systems use CP databases because ensuring accurate account balances is more critical than being always available.*
> 

### **2. AP database**

An AP database is a type of database that prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance from the CAP theorem.

- **Availability**: The database ensures that every request (read or write) gets a response, even if some parts of the system are down.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The database continues to work and provide responses even if there is a network partition (communication break between different parts of the system).

AP databases may not guarantee Consistency (in the strictest sense), meaning different nodes might have slightly different data for a short time.

> ***Example:** Cassandra, In this system, the focus is on ensuring that the database can always respond to requests, even if some parts of the system are temporarily unavailable or can't communicate with each other.*
> 

### **3. CA Database**

A CA database is a type of database that prioritizes Consistency and Availability but does not guarantee Partition Tolerance.

- **Consistency** means that every read from the database returns the most recent write. All users see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability** means that the database is always available to respond to queries, even if some parts of the system fail.

However, Partition Tolerance is sacrificed in a CA database. This means that if there is a network issue, the database might stop functioning rather than returning inconsistent or unavailable data.

> ***Example:** CA databases are ideal when network partitioning is not a common concern, such as in smaller, local systems where quick, consistent access to data is more important than handling major network failures.*

## **Choosing the Right Database for Your Application**

Choosing the right database depends on the needs of your application. Here are a few key factors to consider when making this decision:

### **1. Data Structure**

Defines how data is organized, stored, and managed within the database system.

- **Relational Databases (SQL):** Best for structured data with clearly defined tables and relationships.
- **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):** Suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data with flexible formats.

### **2. Scalability Needs**

Determines how well a database can handle growing data and increasing user traffic.

- **Relational Databases:** Usually scale vertically by increasing the resources of a single server.
- **Non-Relational Databases:** Commonly scale horizontally by adding more servers to distribute workload.

### **3. Consistency Vs Availability**

Represents the balance between maintaining strict data accuracy and ensuring continuous system availability.

- **Relational Databases:** Preferred when applications require strong consistency and accurate transactions.
- **Non-Relational Databases:** Better suited for systems needing high availability even with temporary data inconsistency.

### **4. Transaction Support**

Refers to how reliably a database processes and maintains data during operations.

- **Relational Databases:** Support ACID properties ensuring reliable and consistent transactions.
- **Non-Relational Databases:** Often prioritize speed and flexibility over strict transactional guarantees.

### **5. Development Speed & Flexibility**

Indicates how easily the database can adapt to changing application requirements.

- **Relational Databases:** Suitable when the data structure is stable and well-defined.
- **Non-Relational Databases:** Ideal for rapidly evolving applications with frequently changing data structures.

## **Database Patterns**

Database patterns are established solutions or best practices to address common challenges in managing databases. They help improve performance, scalability, reliability, and maintainability in large or complex systems. Here are some important database patterns:

### **1. Data Sharding**

[Sharding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/database-sharding-a-system-design-concept/) is a technique used to divide a large database into smaller parts called shards, which are stored across multiple servers. It helps distribute data and workload, improving database scalability and performance.

- **Improves scalability:** Data is distributed across multiple servers so the system can handle more users and traffic.
- **Enhances performance:** Each server manages a smaller portion of data, reducing load and speeding up queries.

### **2. Data Partitioning**

[Partitioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/data-partitioning-techniques/) is a technique used to divide a large dataset into smaller parts called partitions, usually stored within the same database or server. It helps organize data efficiently and improves performance when working with large datasets.

- **Improves query performance:** Queries access only the relevant partition instead of scanning the entire dataset.
- **Simplifies data management:** Large datasets become easier to maintain, organize, and process.

### **3. Master-Slave Replication**

[Master-slave replication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/types-of-database-replication-system-design/) is a database replication technique where the master database handles write operations, while slave databases replicate the data and handle read operations. This helps distribute workload and improve database performance.

- **Improves read performance:** Read queries are handled by slave databases, reducing load on the master.
- **Provides redundancy:** If the master fails, a slave database can be promoted to become the new master.

### **4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

[CQRS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/cqrs-command-query-responsibility-segregation/) is a design pattern that separates write operations (commands) and read operations (queries) into different models. This allows each part to be optimized for its specific workload.

- **Optimizes performance:** Read and write operations are handled by separate models designed for their specific tasks.
- **Improves scalability:** Systems can scale reads and writes independently based on workload demands.

### **5. Database Normalization**

[Normalization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/introduction-of-database-normalization/) is the process of organizing data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy and maintain data integrity. Each table represents a specific entity to avoid duplication and inconsistencies.

- **Reduces data redundancy:** Prevents duplicate data by storing information in separate related tables.
- **Improves data consistency:** Ensures accurate and reliable data across the database.

### **6. Data Consistency Patterns**

[Data consistency patterns](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/consistency-in-system-design/) are techniques used to ensure that data remains consistent across multiple databases or servers in distributed systems. They help maintain reliability and accuracy even when systems are distributed across different locations.

- **Maintains data reliability:** Ensures all systems have correct and consistent data.
- **Handles distributed failures:** Helps maintain consistency even during network or system failures.

## **Challenges in Database Design**
