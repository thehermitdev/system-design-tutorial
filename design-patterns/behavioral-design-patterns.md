# **Behavioral Design Patterns**

Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects communicate and collaborate to manage responsibilities effectively. They improve flexibility and simplify complex control flows within a system.

- Facilitate clear communication and responsibility sharing between objects, helping manage complex workflows and control structures.
- Promote loose coupling between components, improving system flexibility and maintainability.

## **Types of Behavioral Design Patterns**

There are mainly 10 types of Behavioral design patterns:

### **1. Observer Method Design Pattern**

[Observer method or Observer design pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/observer-pattern-set-1-introduction/) also known as dependents and publish-subscribe. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object automatically notifies and updates all its dependents.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when multiple objects need to stay updated with changes in another object without tight coupling.

- When a change in one object requires updates in multiple other objects, and the number of dependents is unknown.
- When an object needs to notify others without knowing their concrete implementations.

### **Uses of Observer Design Pattern**

It is mainly used to handle automatic updates and maintain consistency across related objects.

- Automatically updates multiple objects when the state of a subject changes.
- Commonly used in publish-subscribe systems like GUI event handling.
- Helps achieve loose coupling between subjects and observers

### **2. Strategy Method Design Pattern**

**Strategy method or Strategy Design Pattern** also known as Policy, it define a family of algorithm, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when multiple algorithms can be selected or switched dynamically based on different conditions.

- When you have multiple algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, compression) that can be used interchangeably.
- When you need to choose or switch algorithms at runtime based on user input, configuration, or system state.

### **Uses of Strategy Design Pattern**

It helps in organizing and managing different behaviors in a flexible and reusable way.

- Allows switching between algorithms without modifying client code.
- Supports implementing interchangeable behaviors like sorting, searching, or payment methods.
- Reduces the need for complex conditional statements for selecting algorithms.

### **3. State Method Design Pattern**

[State method or State Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/strategy-pattern-set-1/) also known as objects for states, it allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when an object’s behavior depends on its state and changes frequently.

- When conditional logic (if-else or switch-case) becomes complex and hard to manage.
- When an object frequently transitions between different states with different behaviors.

### **Uses of State Design Pattern:**

It helps in organizing state-specific behavior in a structured and maintainable way.

- Enables changing behavior dynamically based on internal state.
- Simplifies complex conditional logic by replacing it with state classes.
- Encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes for better maintainability.

### **4. Command Method Design Pattern**

[Command Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/command-pattern/) converts a request into a standalone object that contains the method, its parameters, and the receiver, enabling flexible request handling.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when you need to decouple the sender of a request from the object that executes it.

- When you want to separate the requester (sender) from the executor (receiver).
- When your application requires support for undo and redo operations.

### **Uses of Command Design Pattern**

It helps in encapsulating requests and managing them efficiently.

- Decouples the sender and receiver of a request.
- Supports undo/redo functionality.
- Allows queuing, logging, or scheduling requests for later execution.

### **5. Chain Of Responsibility Method Design Pattern**

[Chain of Responsibility design pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/chain-responsibility-design-pattern/) allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process it or pass it to the next handler.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when multiple objects can handle a request, and the handler is not known in advance.

- When you want to pass requests dynamically without specifying the exact receiver.
- When you need flexible and extensible processing of requests.

### **Uses of Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern**

It helps in building flexible and decoupled request-processing systems.

- Allows multiple objects to handle a request sequentially.
- Creates processing pipelines for handling operations.
- Reduces coupling between sender and receiver of a request.

### **6. Template Method Design Pattern**

[Template method or Template Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/template-method-design-pattern/), define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the overall structure.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when you want to maintain a fixed algorithm structure but allow flexibility in specific steps.

- When similar processes need to be performed in different contexts.
- When you want to enforce a sequence of steps while allowing customization in parts of the algorithm.

### **Uses of Template Method Design Pattern**

It helps in reusing common logic while allowing controlled customization.

- Enforces a consistent sequence of steps in an algorithm.
- Reduces code duplication by sharing common structure.
- Provides a base class with extensible steps for subclasses.

### **7. Interpreter Method Design Pattern**

[Interpreter design pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/interpreter-design-pattern/) defines a way to represent and evaluate language grammar or expressions by modeling them as a set of classes.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when your application needs to interpret structured expressions or commands.

- When working with domain-specific languages (DSLs).
- When new operations or grammar rules need to be added frequently.

### **Uses of Interpreter Design Pattern**

It helps in building systems that can process and evaluate custom languages or expressions.

- Enables interpretation and evaluation of expressions at runtime.
- Useful for implementing DSLs.
- Allows easy extension by adding new grammar rules.

### **8. Visitor Method Design Pattern**

[Visitor design pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/visitor-design-pattern/) allows adding new operations to related classes without modifying their structure. It is useful when classes are stable but operations need to be extended easily.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when the object structure is stable but new operations need to be added frequently.

- When you have related classes and need to perform different operations on them.
- When you want to extend functionality without modifying existing classes.

### **Uses of Visitor Design Pattern**

It helps in separating operations from object structures for better maintainability.

- Performs operations across a set of objects without changing their classes.
- Keeps algorithms separate from the object structure.
- Allows adding new functionality without altering existing code.

### **9. Mediator Method Design Pattern**

[Mediator Design Pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/mediator-design-pattern/) defines an object that controls and manages interactions between multiple objects, promoting loose coupling.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when multiple objects interact in complex ways and need centralized coordination.

- When objects need to communicate in a complex manner.
- When you want a single point to manage and organize interactions.

### **Uses of Mediator Design Pattern**

It helps in simplifying communication and reducing dependencies between objects.

- Centralizes complex interactions between objects.
- Reduces direct dependencies, promoting loose coupling.
- Improves maintainability by handling interaction logic in one place.

### **10. Memento Method Design Patterns**

[Memento design pattern](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/memento-design-pattern/) captures and restores an object’s internal state without breaking encapsulation. It enables undo or rollback by saving and restoring previous states of an object.

### **When to use**

Use this pattern when you need to save and restore an object’s state at different points in time.

- When implementing features like versioning or checkpoints.
- When rollback is required in case of errors or exceptions.

### **Uses of Memento Design Pattern**

It helps in managing object state safely and efficiently.

- Supports undo or rollback functionality.

## **Challenges of Behavioral Design Patterns**

While useful, behavioral patterns can also introduce complexity that developers must manage carefully.

- Can increase system complexity, making code harder to understand.
- Overuse may lead to a high number of small classes and objects.
- Debugging can be difficult due to multiple layers of indirection.
- Misuse may reduce performance or make behavior tracking harder
