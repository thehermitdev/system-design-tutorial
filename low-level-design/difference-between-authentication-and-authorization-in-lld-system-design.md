# **Authentication vs Authorization in LLD - System Design**

Two fundamental ideas in system design, particularly in low-level design (LLD), are authentication and authorization.

- **Authentication** confirms a person's identity.
- **Authorization** establishes what resources or actions a user is permitted to access.

## **Authentication Methods**

- **Password-based Authentication**
    - **Description:** The most common form of authentication, in this users provide a unique password to verify their identity.
    - **Considerations:** Passwords should be complex, stored securely, and users should be encouraged to use unique passwords.
- [**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/multifactor-authentication/)
    - **Description:** Requires users to provide multiple forms of identification, such as a password and a temporary code is sent to their mobile device.
    - **Advantages:** Enhances security by adding an extra layer of verification, even if one factor is compromised.
- [**Biometric Authentication**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/what-is-biometric-verification/)
    - **Description:** Involves using unique physical or behavioral characteristics for identification, like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition.
    - **Considerations:** Biometric data should be securely stored and processed to prevent unauthorized access.
- [**Token-based Authentication**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/how-does-the-token-based-authentication-work/)
    - **Description:** Users are given a physical or digital token (like a security key or smart card) for authentication.
    - **Advantages:** Provides an additional physical element that needs to be present for authentication.
- [**OAuth Connect**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/workflow-of-oauth-2-0/)
    - **Description:** Protocols used for authentication and authorization in the context of web applications and APIs.
    - **Use Cases:** Commonly used for delegated authorization, allowing third-party applications to access user data.

## **Authorization Models**

Ensuring that only authorized individuals or entities have access to particular resources, functionality, or information is an essential component of security.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - Assigning roles to users or groups, letting them access only what their role requires.
    - **Example:** HR personnel can access HR data but not finance information.
- **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML):**
    - Using an XML-based protocol for Single Sign-On, allowing admins to control resource access.
    - **Example:** Access permissions are communicated through digitally signed documents.
- **OpenID Authorization:**
    - Checking a user's identity through OpenID standards, ensuring consistency across systems.
    - **Example:** Standardised authorization based on authentication from an authorization server.
- **OAuth Authorization:**
    - It allows secure access within applications using permission tokens.
    - **Example:** Users grant access to their information to certain apps without sharing their password.
- **Device Permissions:**
    - Granting access based on the device trying to connect to a resource.
    - **Example:** Only approved devices can establish a connection.

## **Differences between Authentication and Authorization**

| **Aspect** | **Authentication** | **Authorization** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Verifies the user's identity. | Determines the user's access to resources or actions. |
| **Focus** | "Who are you?" | "What are you allowed to do?" |
| **Process** | Typically involves usernames, passwords, or biometrics. | Involves checking permissions or roles assigned to the user. |
| **Order** | Happens before Authorization. | Happens after Authentication. |
| **Scope** | Ensures the user is genuine. | Ensures the user has access rights. |
| **Implementation** | Login pages, OTP, fingerprint scans. | Role-based access control (RBAC), policy checks. |
| **Example** | Entering a password to log into an account. | Checking if the logged-in user can view or edit a file. |
| **Security Purpose** | Protects against unauthorized user access. | Protects against unauthorized actions by authenticated users. |
