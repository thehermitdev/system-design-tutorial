## **Steps and ways to ensure the security of a system**

Securing a system involves multiple layers of protection to safeguard data, users, and resources from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

### **1. Authentication and Authorization**

Authentication is a crucial step to verify the identity of a user accessing the system. Some of the most popular ways of **authenticating** are

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Biometrics
- Emphasis on strong password policy
- Single Sign-On.

Authorization is a process in which the authority of the particular user trying to access a system is checked. Some of the most common ways of **authorization** are

- Attribute Based Access Control
- Least Privilege Principle
- Review the Accesses
- Resource Based Authorization.

> ***Example:** When you enter your Netflix account, authentication checks your username and password to confirm your identity, while authorization decides which profiles you can access and what content you’re allowed to watch.*
> 

### **2. Data Encryption**

Data Encryption is also a crucial step to ensure the safety of any system. Some of the key aspects to ensure **data encryption** are

- Select strong encryption algorithm like AES
- Use secure protocols like HTTPS, TLS, SSL while transferring data from source to destination.
- Encrypt stored data using different encryption types like full-disk encryption.
- Create a secure key management system to generate, store and update encryption keys whenever necessary.
- Use End to End encryption for the user generated contents and other sensitive communications.

> ***Example:** A messaging app encrypts messages end-to-end using AES and TLS, so only the sender and receiver can read the content even if intercepted.*
> 

## **Secure Coding Practices**

Secure Coding Practices are necessary to safeguard a system from various types of Cyber Threats. Some of the Secure Coding Practices is given below:

- **Input validation:** It is necessary to always validate user inputs to prevent threats like SQL Injection and XSS (Cross Site Scripting).
- **Access Control:** Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to use.
- **Secure Authentication:** Use of secure authentication methods like MFA , Face Recognition etc.
- **Error Handling:** Use meaningful error messages and logging information to avoid potential leak of sensitive and confidential data publicly which could be used by hackers.
- **Regular Updates and Patch Management:** Updating the security components alongside libraries and patches is a must to safeguard the system from cyber attacks.

## **Network Security**

Having a strict network security policy creates a safe passage to transfer data or information keeping their integrity and security.

- **Installing Firewalls and IDS:** Firewalls act as a filter to sort out the incoming packets from untrusted public networks and entering trusted private networks or devices. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is also useful to identify if anything fishy is happening in the network.
- **Use Encryption:** Use of encryption protocols like SSL or TLS to secure the data transmission, it restricts any third party from doing eavesdropping and data interception, ensuring the integrity of the data transmitted.
- **Access Control:** Implement RBAC (Role Based Access Control) to ensure that no one gets any other extra access to any of the services which they shouldn't get. It is also necessary to review and make changes to those accesses regularly if needed.
- **Network Monitoring and Logging:** Continuous monitoring of the network to ensure there is no unauthorized access or anomaly is found. Detailed log of the network activities can also be used to detect any anomaly or security vulnerabilities.

> ***Example:** A company uses a firewall to block untrusted traffic, encrypts all API communications with TLS, and monitors network logs to detect any unauthorized access attempts.*

## **Incident Response and Disaster Recovery (IR/DR)**

### **Incident Response (IR)**

As the named suggests, Incident Response responds to the cybersecurity incidents happening in the system which can range from cyber attacks to data breaches and malware infections. A generic IR plan consists of following phases-

- **Preparation:** Creating a plan to respond with a particular incident, identify the critical assets and form a incident response team.
- **Identification of the Issue:** By analyzing the system logs, the issue is being detected and categorized
- **Containment:** Taking some immediate action to stop the spreading of the malware and affect the entire system.
- **Eradication:** Identifying the root cause of the issue and remove it from all the affected areas of the system.
- **Recovery:** After eradication, it is time to recover the system to it's original non affected status and improve the security measures to prevent future attacks.

> ***Example:** A company detects unusual login activity indicating a potential breach. The IR team isolates affected servers, removes malware, restores clean backups, and implements stronger authentication measures.*
> 

### **Disaster Recovery (DR)**

Disaster Recovery mainly deals with Physical issues like Hard Disk failure, problems in Motherboard or RAM or any other physical part of the system. It deals with hardware based issue and tries to ensure that the system continues to work in the same way by solving the issues. This involves -

- **Data Backup:** Backing up data regularly to a cloud based or any other place is a very important step to ensure the availability of the data even if the system faces any issue from hardware side.
- **Redundancy:** Use redundant hardware, data center etc to make multiple copies of the same file so that if one system fails the file is still accessible.
- **Business Continuity Planning:** Develop strategies to continue the essential business processes even after a disaster.
- **Testing and Performing Drill:** Regularly test the disaster recovery plan via testing and simulation to ensure the system is ready to handle those kind of situations.

> ***Example:** A server fails due to a hard drive crash. Because the company has a redundant server and cloud backups, operations continue seamlessly while the faulty hardware is replaced.*
> 

## **Physical Security**

Physical Security is also a crucial component when it comes to system design. Below are some of the main reason why it is important.

- **Protection of Hardware:** Physical security measures are crucial for safeguarding the hardware components of a system. Data Centers, Servers, Network Devices need to be protected from theft, vandalism or any other harm.
- **Data Protection:** Gaining access to the Physical Hardware mostly means gaining access to the data stored in it, so to protect the data stored in the physical components, physical security is very much needed.
- **Business Continuity:** Any kind of Disaster whether it is man made or natural can disrupt the operations, so to ensure that the system keeps working after some disaster like fire or failure of power supply, having a physical security measure is always good.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:** Physical Security can also be used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Physical Asset Protection:** Physical Security is also useful to protect the physical assets, such as hardware devices from thefts, vandalize, damage or misuse.

> ***Example:** A company installs biometric access controls and CCTV in its data center. Even if someone tries to break in, only authorized personnel can access the servers, protecting sensitive data and hardware.*
> 

## **Secure Communication Protocols**

Using secure protocols like SSL/TLS and HTTPS while transferring data is highly recommended to securely transmit sensitive data, most of the industries use this. By safeguarding communication, systems mitigate the risk of data breaches, maintain it's credibility, and assure users that their information is safely stored or transmitted.

Some of the mostly used communication protocols are given below -

- **Secure Sockets Layer**/ Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (Secured) (HTTPS)
- **Secure Shell** (SSH)
- **Internet Protocol Security** (IPSec)
- **S/MIME** (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
- **Pretty Good Privacy** (PGP)

> ***Example:** An e-commerce website uses HTTPS for all customer transactions. Even if a hacker intercepts network traffic, the data is encrypted and unreadable.*
> 

## **Third-Party Risk Management**

Modern Systems rely on various third party applications like APIs and Cloud Services, so it is easy to get affected by any of them.

System Administrators need to evaluate their Security approaches from these third-party services. A failure or breach from the Third-Party service can lead to severe issues like data leak, system disruption and most importantly reputation damage.

> ***Example:** A fintech company uses a third-party payment gateway but regularly audits its security certifications. This ensures customer payment data remains safe, even if the third-party service faces a threat.*
