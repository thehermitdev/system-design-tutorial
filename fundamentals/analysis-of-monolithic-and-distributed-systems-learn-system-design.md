# **Analysis of Monolithic and Distributed Systems - Learn System Design**

System Analysis and Design is the process of understanding business requirements and creating a structured solution to meet those needs. System analysis focuses on identifying problems and gathering requirements, while system design focuses on building the architecture and components of the system.

- Helps identify system requirements and problems before development.
- Improves system structure, performance, and component interaction.
- Converts requirements into an efficient and scalable system design.

## **Types of Systems in System Analysis and Design**

Now that we understand system analysis and how it differs from system design, it is important to explore the major types of systems used in system design. These systems define how applications are structured and deployed in real-world scenarios.

Generally, systems can be categorized into two main types:

- Monolithic Systems
- Distributed Systems

## **Monolithic Systems**

A monolithic application is a software system where all functionalities exist within a single codebase. It is built as one large, unified block, with tightly integrated components that are developed and deployed together.

- **Single Deployment:** All features are packaged and deployed as one unit.
- **Tightly Coupled Components:** Changes in one part can affect the entire system.

### **Monolithic Architecture**

The Monolithic system architecture can be visualized by considering three sections or three layers:

- **Client Tier or User Layer or Presentation Layer:** It is the closest layer to the user and hence it can be either a webpage or a web application where the user gets things done. It takes input lead from the user, interacts with the server, and displays the user result. Hence we call it a front-end layer.
- **Middle Tier or Service Layer:** It compromises all the logic behind the application and is there in the application server. The application server includes the business logic, receives requests from the client, acts on them, and correspondingly stores the data.
- **Data Tier or Persistence Layer:** It includes a data persistence mechanism(DB) and communication with other applications. It includes databases, message queues, etc. Database server will be used by application server for the persistence of data. ****

### **Advantages**

Monolithic architecture is simple to build and manage, making it suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

- It follows a traditional approach and is easier to develop initially since all components are part of a single codebase.
- All components exist in one repository, so the entire application can be deployed as a single unit.
- Due to tight integration, end-to-end testing is straightforward and easier to perform using testing tools.

> ***Tip:** Monolithic architecture is commonly used by organizations in the early stages because it has fewer cross-cutting concerns such as caching, logging, and handling. Since everything is managed in a single system, it becomes easier to develop, debug, and maintain initially.*

### **Disadvantages**

Monolithic architecture can become difficult to manage and scale as the application grows in size and complexity.

- The codebase is stored in a single repository, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain over time.
- Any changes in the codebase require complete redeployment of the entire application.
- Less reusable, as components are tightly coupled within the system.
- Less scalable because different components may have different scalability requirements, but must be scaled together.

## **Microservices**

Microservices is an architectural style in which an application is built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service handles a specific functionality and communicates with other services using lightweight protocols such as HTTP.

### **Microservices Architecture**

The Microservice architecture has a significant impact on the relationship between the application and the database.

- Instead of sharing a single database with other microservices, each microservice has its own database.
- It often results in duplication of some data, but having a database per microservice is essential if you want to benefit from this architecture, as it ensures loose coupling.
- Another advantage of having a separate database per microservice is that each microservice can use the type of database best suited for its needs.
- Each service offers a secure module boundary so that different services can be written in different programming languages.
- There are many patterns involved in microservice architecture like service discovery & registry, caching, API gateway & communication, observability, security, etc.

### **Advantages**

Microservices architecture improves scalability, flexibility, and system resilience by dividing the application into independent services.

- **Scalability:** Each service can scale independently, helping optimize resource utilization and reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Flexibility:** Services can be developed, deployed, and updated independently, allowing teams to work on different parts simultaneously.
- **Resilience:** Failure of one service does not impact others, making the overall system more reliable.
- **Technology Heterogeneity:** Different services can use different technologies and programming languages, as long as they can communicate effectively.

### **Disadvantages**

Despite its benefits, microservices architecture introduces complexity and operational challenges.

- **Complexity:** Managing a large number of small services increases development, deployment, and maintenance complexity.
- **Increased overhead:** More network communication and data consistency handling are required between services.
- **Testing complexity:** Ensuring all independent services work together correctly makes testing more difficult.
- **Distributed systems:** Being a distributed system introduces challenges in monitoring, debugging, and management.

| **Monolithic Architecture** | **Microservice Architecture** |
| --- | --- |
| Single-tier architecture | Multi-tier architecture |
| Built as one large application with tightly coupled components | Composed of small, loosely coupled services components |
| Deployed as a single unit | Individual services can be deployed independently |
| Horizontal scaling can be challenging | Easier to scale horizontally |
| Development is simpler initially | Development is more complex due to multiple services |
| Technology stack choices are usually limited | Freedom to choose the best technology for each service |
| Entire application may fail if a part fails | Individual services can fail without affecting others |
| Easier to maintain due to its simplicity | Requires more effort to manage multiple services |
| Less flexible as all components are tightly coupled | More flexible as components can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently |
| Communication between components is faster | Communication may be slower due to network calls |

## **Distributed Systems Vs Microservices**

When adopting a Microservices architecture or migrating from a Monolithic architecture, it’s not feasible to handle all components on a single system—doing so would contradict the modular nature of Microservices. This is precisely where Distributed Systems come into play.

Distributed Systems not only bring modularity to your architecture but also provide a foundation that makes implementing Microservices more efficient and effective. They enable seamless scaling, independent service deployment, and better resource utilization, allowing you to fully leverage the benefits of a Microservices approach.

### **Distributed Systems**

A Distributed System is a collection of independent computers connected through a network that work together by sharing resources to achieve a common goal. These systems communicate and coordinate with each other to perform tasks efficiently and reliably.

- They support high scalability by distributing workloads and resources across multiple machines or servers.
- They reduce the risk of Single Point of Failure (SPOF), improving system reliability and fault tolerance.

In a distributed system, data is replicated across multiple geographically distributed servers. If one node fails due to issues like power failure, the replicated data on other servers remains available, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance.

- Replication and redundancy prevent data loss by maintaining backup copies across multiple nodes.
- They eliminate Single Point of Failure (SPOF) and ensure continuous system availability even during failures.

### **Advantages**

Distributed systems provide high scalability, reliability, and improved performance by using multiple interconnected machines.

- **Scalable:** Since it consists of independent machines, horizontal scaling can be easily achieved.
- **Reliable:** Eliminates Single Point of Failure (SPOF); even if one node fails, others continue to operate.
- **Low latency:** Multiple geographically distributed servers help serve users faster by reducing response time.

### **Disadvantages**

Despite their benefits, distributed systems introduce complexity in management, communication, and data consistency.

- **Complexity:** A large number of nodes and network connections make the system difficult to design and maintain.
- **Consistency:** Maintaining synchronized data across multiple nodes becomes challenging.
- **Network Failure:** Communication depends on network calls, so failures can lead to delays, data conflicts, or system issues.

> ***Note:** Management is also a disadvantage here out because of load balancing functionality(It is a process of distributing the load to the nodes), logging, caching and monitoing is required to manage the systemto prevent failures.*

## **Race Conditions in Monolithic and Distributed Systems**

A race condition occurs when multiple processes or services execute concurrently and the final outcome depends on the timing or order of execution. It typically arises in systems with parallelism where shared resources are accessed without proper synchronization.

Race conditions are commonly seen in operating systems and also occur in scalable systems where multiple requests are processed at the same time, leading to conflicts or inconsistent results.

> ***Example:** Consider a banking system where multiple microservices handle operations like credit card approval. Suppose a service checks a user’s CIBIL score before approving a credit card.*

Now, if multiple requests for the same user are processed simultaneously, two services might read outdated data and both approve or reject incorrectly. This overlapping of operations leads to a race condition.

> ***Note:** Race conditions are very common in distributed systems because multiple services and nodes process requests concurrently. Due to this parallelism, operations may interleave in unpredictable ways, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results if not handled properly.*

### **Handling Race Conditions in Distributed Systems**

Proper handling of race conditions is essential to ensure data consistency and system correctness.

- **Atomic Operations:** Atomic operations combine validation and update steps into a single indivisible operation to maintain data consistency. This helps prevent partial updates and race conditions in distributed systems.
- **Service Refactoring**: Service refactoring moves validation and business logic into a centralized service to ensure consistent decision-making across the system. It improves maintainability and reduces duplicated logic between services.
- **Additional Approaches:** Additional techniques like locking, idempotency, distributed transactions, and event-driven patterns help maintain consistency and reliability in distributed systems. These approaches prevent duplicate operations and coordinate updates across multiple services.
