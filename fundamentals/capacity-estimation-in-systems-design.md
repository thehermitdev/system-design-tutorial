# **Capacity Estimation in Systems Design**

Capacity estimation in [systems design](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/getting-started-with-system-design/) is the process of predicting or determining the maximum load or demand that a system can handle within its operational parameters. This involves analyzing various aspects such as hardware capabilities, software performance, network bandwidth, and user behavior patterns.

- The goal is to ensure that the system can accommodate the expected workload without experiencing performance degradation, [bottlenecks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/bottleneck-conditions-identification-in-system-design/), or failures.
- Capacity estimation is crucial for designing and scaling systems effectively to meet current and future demands, whether it's a website, a network infrastructure, or any other complex system.

## **Factors that affect Capacity Estimation**

Capacity estimation in system design depends on various factors, including:

- **Hardware Resources:** The capacity of a system depends on hardware components such as processors, memory, storage, and network interfaces. Better hardware resources generally increase system capacity.
- **Software Efficiency:** Efficient algorithms, optimized code, and well-designed software help make better use of hardware resources and improve overall system performance.
- **Workload Characteristics:** The nature, volume, and variability of workloads determine how much capacity the system requires to operate effectively.
- **User Behavior:** User activity patterns, transaction frequency, and concurrent access levels directly affect the system's capacity requirements.
- **Scalability:** The ability to add resources vertically or horizontally helps the system handle growing workloads and improve capacity.
- **Performance Metrics:** Metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization are used to measure and estimate system capacity.
- **Failure Scenarios:** Considering hardware failures, network outages, and other disruptions helps ensure sufficient capacity for reliability and fault tolerance.

## **Metrics for Capacity Estimation**

In system design, several metrics are crucial for capacity estimation:

- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** This metric represents the number of unique users who access the application each day. It helps estimate the overall daily traffic the system must support.
- **Queries Per Second (QPS):** QPS measures the number of requests processed by the system every second. It indicates the load on servers and helps determine processing capacity.
- **Storage Requirements:** This metric defines the amount of data the system needs to store over time. It helps plan database and storage infrastructure capacity.
- **Error Rates:** Error rate measures the percentage of requests that fail or produce errors. It is an important indicator of system reliability and stability.
- **Response Time:** Response time is the duration the system takes to process a request and return a result. Lower response times generally indicate better performance.
- **Concurrency:** Concurrency refers to the number of users or requests the system can handle simultaneously without performance degradation.
- **Peak Load Handling:** This metric measures the maximum traffic or workload the system can support during peak usage periods while maintaining acceptable performance.

## **Methods and Techniques for Capacity Estimation**

Capacity estimation in system design involves various methods and techniques to accurately predict the system's ability to handle workload. Here are some commonly used approaches:

- **Traffic Analysis:** This method studies user activity patterns, request volumes, and usage trends to estimate the load a system must handle.
- **Forecasting:** Forecasting uses historical data to predict future traffic growth and capacity requirements, helping organizations prepare for increased demand.
- **Stress Testing:** Stress testing intentionally pushes the system beyond normal limits to identify its breaking point and uncover performance bottlenecks.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** This approach analyzes past usage patterns and peak traffic periods to estimate future capacity needs more accurately.
- **Load Testing:** Load testing gradually increases workload levels to measure system performance and determine its capacity limits.
- **Capacity Planning Tools:** Specialized tools monitor resource utilization, performance metrics, and scalability trends to support accurate capacity estimation and planning.

## **Capacity Estimation for Different Components**

Capacity estimation for different components in system design involves assessing the resources required by individual elements to ensure overall system performance. Here's an overview:

### **1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

- Estimate CPU capacity based on factors such as processing power, clock speed, and the number of cores.
- Calculate CPU utilization under different workload scenarios to determine if additional processing capacity is needed.

### **2. Memory (RAM)**

- Assess memory requirements by analyzing the system's memory usage patterns.
- Estimate peak memory usage and ensure sufficient RAM to accommodate simultaneous tasks and prevent performance degradation due to swapping or paging.

### **3. Storage**

- Estimate storage capacity based on data growth rates, anticipated file sizes, and storage types (e.g., SSD, HDD).
- Consider factors like redundancy, data replication, and backup requirements when estimating storage capacity.

### **4. Network Bandwidth**

- Evaluate network bandwidth requirements by analyzing expected data transfer rates, network traffic patterns, and communication protocols.
- Consider factors like peak usage periods, data compression, and network latency in capacity estimation.

### **5. Database Resources**

## **Case Studies and Examples**

### **1. E-commerce website**

Let's you are building an online store and need to estimate capacity for a Black Friday sale. Here's how you would proceed:

**Define Key Metrics**

> *Estimate 200,000 DAU and Each user makes 8 requests per visit, leading to a total of 1,600,000 requests.*

- **QPS**= 1,600,000/86,400 = **18.52**
- **Storage requirements**: If each user generates 5 MB of data, the total daily storage requirement is 200,000×5MB=1,000,000MB=1,000GB
- **Concurrent users**: 25% of DAU will be active at the same time, so: 200,000×0.25=50,000 concurrent users
- **Conduct Load Testing:** Use Apache JMeter to simulate 50,000 users and monitor the system's response time and error rates.
- **Perform Stress Testing:** Test the system with 250,000 users to identify any potential bottlenecks.
- **Capacity Planning:** Based on test results, scale the infrastructure by adding more servers or optimizing resources like caching.
- **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Once live, monitor key metrics like DAU, QPS, and error rates using tools like Grafana.

### **2. Cloud Infrastructure Capacity Planning:**

- **Scenario:** A company migrates its on-premises infrastructure to the cloud and needs to estimate the capacity requirements for various cloud resources.
- **Capacity Estimation:** The company analyzes historical usage data to identify resource utilization patterns and predicts future growth trends.
- **Example Metrics:** They estimate that their cloud environment requires 100 virtual machines, 10 TB of storage, and 1 Gbps of network bandwidth to support anticipated workloads.
- **Optimization Strategy:** The company implements auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust resource allocation based on demand fluctuations, optimizing cost and performance.
- **Outcome:** By accurately estimating capacity requirements and implementing efficient resource management strategies, the company achieves cost-effective scalability and maintains high system availability in the cloud.

## **Challenges and Considerations**
