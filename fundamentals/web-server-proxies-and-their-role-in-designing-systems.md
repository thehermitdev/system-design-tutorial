# **Web and Application Server in Designing Systems**

Web servers and application servers are essential components in system design that handle user requests and deliver responses efficiently. A web server manages client communication, while an application server processes business logic and dynamic operations.

- Web servers handle HTTP requests, serve static content, and manage communication between clients and servers.
- Application servers execute business logic, process dynamic data, and generate responses for client requests.

## **Web Server**

A web server is a system that stores, processes, and delivers web content to users over the internet. It handles requests from clients (like browsers) and responds with web pages, images, or data. A web server can be both hardware (machine) and software that manages these requests.

- Hosts websites and serves content to users, running web server software like Apache or IIS.
- Requires continuous internet connectivity to handle incoming client requests.

> **Example:** When you type a website URL in your browser, the request goes to a web server, which processes it and sends back the webpage to be displayed.

Every web server connected to the internet is given a unique address of 4 digits that are separated by dots as **68.122.31.125**

### **Types of web server**

Web servers can be categorized based on how they host websites and handle traffic.

- **Shared Hosting:** Hosts multiple websites (often 100+) on a single server. It is cost-effective and suitable for small or personal websites.
- **Dedicated Hosting:** A single server is dedicated to one or a few websites, offering better performance, control, and security.
- **Custom Hosting:** Built specifically for large-scale applications with unique requirements, allowing full customization and high scalability.

Small or personal websites usually use shared hosting, while high-traffic applications prefer dedicated or custom hosting for better performance and control.

### **Working**

A web server processes client requests and returns the required web content using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. It acts as a bridge between the user (browser) and the backend systems.

- When a user sends a request (like opening a website), the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
- If the requested content is static (HTML, CSS, images), the web server directly sends it back to the client.
- If the request is for dynamic content, the web server forwards it to an application server or backend service for processing.
- The application server processes the request (e.g., fetching data from a database) and sends the result back to the web server.
- Finally, the web server returns the response to the client’s browser.

> **Example:** When you open a shopping website, the homepage (static content) loads directly from the web server. But when you search for a product, the request goes to the backend, which fetches results from the database and sends them back through the web server to your browser.

### **Role of Web Servers**

Web servers play a crucial role in handling client requests and delivering web content efficiently and securely.

- **Handling Client Requests:** Web servers receive and process incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients (browsers) and route them to the appropriate resources or services.
- **Serving Static and Dynamic Content:** They directly serve static content (HTML, CSS, images) and work with application servers to generate and deliver dynamic content.
- **Load Balancing:** In large systems, web servers distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to improve performance and prevent overload.
- **Content Delivery & Caching:** Web servers cache frequently accessed content to reduce response time and decrease server load.
- **SSL/TLS Termination:** They handle encryption and decryption of data, ensuring secure communication between clients and servers without burdening backend systems.

### **Static Vs Dynamic Web Servers**

Web servers can serve both static and dynamic content based on the type of application and backend processing involved.

**Static Web Servers**: Serve content exactly as stored, without any modification.

- Sends files like HTML, CSS, images directly to the browser
- Faster performance as no processing is required
- Suitable for blogs, portfolios, and simple websites

**Dynamic Web Servers**: Generate and update content in real-time using additional software like application servers and databases.

- Processes user input and fetches data dynamically
- Provides personalized and interactive content
- Suitable for social media, e-commerce, and web apps

### **Protocols Used**

Web servers use standard communication protocols to exchange data with clients over the internet.

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Used to transfer web pages and resources between client and server
- **HTTPS:** Secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transmission
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files between systems, often for uploading website content

### **Examples**

Some of the popular web servers used in real-world applications are:

- **Apache HTTP Server:** One of the most widely used web servers, it handles HTTP requests and serves web pages and files efficiently. It is highly reliable and supported by a large ecosystem.
- **Tomcat Server:** Commonly used for Java-based web applications. It acts as both a web server and a servlet container, but it is not a full-fledged application server.
- **Node.js Server:** Provides a built-in HTTP module that allows developers to create lightweight and fast web servers, especially for real-time applications.

## **Application Server**

An application server is designed to run and manage business logic and complex operations required by applications. It provides an environment (hardware + software) to execute dynamic tasks and process client requests beyond simple content delivery.

- Handles complex logic and computations (e.g., processing requests and transactions) and interacts with databases/services to generate dynamic content.
- Provides an environment to run applications such as enterprise or cloud-based systems.

> **Example:** When you log in to a banking app, the application server verifies your credentials, fetches account data from the database, and sends the result back to the web server to display in your browser.

> **Note:** An application server is used when the system requires heavy processing or dynamic operations that a web server alone cannot efficiently handle.

### **Working**

Application servers follow a client-server model where they process user requests, execute business logic, and return dynamic responses. They act as the core layer that handles application functionality and data processing.

- The client (browser/mobile app) sends a request to the web server
- The web server forwards dynamic requests to the application server
- The application server executes business logic (e.g., authentication, transactions)
- It interacts with databases or external services to fetch or update data
- The processed result is sent back to the web server, which returns it to the client

**Layers Involved:**

- Presentation Layer: Handles user interface and request/response formatting
- Application Layer: Contains business logic and processing
- Data Access Layer: Manages interaction with databases

### **Popular Application Servers**

Application servers provide an environment to run and manage applications, supporting different technologies and frameworks.

- **Apache Tomcat:** Widely used for Java-based web applications; acts as a servlet container and lightweight application server
- **JBoss (WildFly):** A full-featured Java EE application server used for enterprise applications
- **IBM WebSphere Application Server:** Enterprise-grade server designed for large-scale, secure, and high-performance applications
- **Oracle WebLogic Server:** Robust application server used for mission-critical enterprise systems
- **Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services):** Supports ASP.NET applications and is commonly used in Windows-based environments

### **Advantages**

Application servers provide powerful features for handling complex and dynamic applications.

- **Handles Complex Logic:** Efficiently processes business logic and heavy computations
- **Scalability:** Can handle increasing users and traffic with proper configuration
- **Integration Support:** Easily connects with databases, APIs, and external services
- **Security Features:** Supports authentication, authorization, and secure transactions

### **Disadvantages**

Despite their benefits, application servers also have some limitations.

- **High Complexity:** More complex to set up and manage compared to web servers
- **Higher Cost:** Maintenance and deployment can be expensive
- **Latency Overhead:** Additional processing may increase response time
- **Not Needed for Simple Apps:** Overkill for small or static websites

## **Web Server Vs Application Server**

These two servers differ based on their roles, where a web server handles client requests and content delivery, while an application server processes business logic and dynamic operations.

| **Web Server** | **Application Server** |
| --- | --- |
| Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests | Handles business logic and processing |
| Serves static content | Generates dynamic content |
| Lightweight and faster | Heavier and resource-intensive |
| Limited or no database interaction | Direct interaction with databases |
| **Example:** Apache, Nginx | **Example:** Tomcat, WebLogic |
