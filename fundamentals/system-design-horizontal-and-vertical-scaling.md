# **Horizontal and Vertical Scaling | System Design**

In system design, scaling is important for managing increased loads. Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling are two different approaches to scaling a system, both of which can be used to improve the performance and capacity of the system.

- Adding more servers or instances to distribute load and handle high traffic efficiently.
- Upgrading a single server’s CPU, RAM, or storage to increase its capacity.

> ***Example:** A large e-commerce platform may use horizontal scaling by adding more servers during high traffic events like sales, while a small application may use vertical scaling by upgrading the server’s RAM or CPU.*

## **Need of Scaling**

We need scaling to handle increasing load and improve performance, while resilience is achieved through fault tolerance, redundancy, and recovery mechanisms.

- We need scaling to handle increasing system load efficiently and provide a smooth and reliable user experience.
- Handle increased user load and traffic without slowing down or crashing the system during peak usage.
- Ensure high availability and reliability so the system remains accessible even during failures or heavy demand.
- Maintain performance and response time by distributing workload and avoiding bottlenecks.
- Support growing data and storage needs as the application expands over time.

The following are two ways to do scaling.

## **Vertical Scaling**

Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, refers to the process of increasing the capacity or capabilities of an individual hardware or software component within a system.

- We upgrade the same system rather than adding more systems. Add more power to your machine by adding better processors, increasing RAM, or other power-increasing adjustments.
- Simple to implement and useful for monolithic and small scale applications.

### **Examples**

The following examples illustrate how vertical scaling improves system capacity by upgrading the resources of a single server.

- Upgrading a MySQL server from 16 GB RAM to 64 GB to handle more queries.
- Moving a website hosted on a 2-core VM to an 8-core, higher-RAM VM to improve performance.
- E-commerce platform running on a single large AWS EC2 instance with increased resources (CPU, RAM, disk).

### **Advantages**

Vertical scaling offers several benefits, especially for applications that need quick performance improvements with minimal architectural changes.

- **Increased capacity:** A server's performance and ability to manage incoming requests can both be enhanced by upgrading its hardware.
- **Easier management:** Upgrading a single node is usually the focus of vertical scaling, which might be simpler than maintaining several nodes.

### **Disadvantages**

Despite its benefits, vertical scaling has certain limitations that can affect system growth and reliability.

- Vertical scaling is constrained by the hardware's physical limitations. Horizontal scaling also has practical limits such as network overhead, coordination complexity, and consistency constraints.
- One server still receives all incoming requests thus increasing the possibility of downtime in the event of a server failure.
- Scaling up often requires restarting or replacing the machine, causing downtime.

## **Horizontal Scaling**

Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, refers to the process of increasing the capacity or performance of a system by adding more machines or servers to distribute the workload across a larger number of individual units.

- There is no need to change the capacity of the server or replace the server.
- Adding more servers usually avoids full downtime, but may involve delays due to deployment, warm-up time, or traffic rebalancing.

### **Examples**

Horizontal scaling is widely used in real-world systems to handle high traffic and ensure availability.

- A website like GeeksforGeeks adds more web servers behind a load balancer to handle traffic spikes.
- Netflix scales different microservices independently — e.g., multiple instances of the streaming service across regions.
- Amazon Auto Scaling spins up more EC2 instances during peak shopping hours (e.g., Black Friday).
- Akamai or Cloudflare uses servers distributed globally to serve content closer to users.

### **Advantages**

Horizontal scaling improves system capacity and reliability by distributing workload across multiple machines.

- **Increased capacity:** More nodes or instances can handle a larger number of incoming requests.
- **Improved performance:** By distributing the load over several nodes or instances, it is less likely that any one server will get overloaded.
- **Increased fault tolerance:** Incoming requests can be sent to another node in the event of a node failure, lowering the possibility of downtime.

### **Disadvantages**

Despite its benefits, horizontal scaling introduces complexity in system design and management.

- Requires complex architecture (load balancers, distributed databases, etc.).
- Difficult to maintain strong consistency across distributed nodes. Requires synchronization, messaging, or replication between nodes.
- More machines = more networking, power, and maintenance.
- Needs orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Ansible) to manage many servers.

## **Differences between Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**

This section highlights the key differences between scaling by adding more machines versus upgrading a single machine.

We have understood the meaning of both the major categories of scaling an application. We also have discussed some pros and cons of each one of them. do a quick comparison of these two approaches based on these pros and cons.

| **Horizontal Scaling** | **Vertical Scaling** |
| --- | --- |
| Adds more machines or servers to distribute the workload. | Increases CPU, RAM, or storage of a single machine. |
| More cost-effective for large-scale systems. | Simpler initially but can become expensive over time. |
| Highly flexible because new servers can be added easily. | Limited flexibility due to hardware limits. |
| Better fault tolerance since workload is spread across multiple machines. | Lower fault tolerance because it depends on one machine. |
| Improves performance by distributing traffic across servers. | Performance improves only up to hardware capacity. |
| Less risk of single point of failure. | Higher risk of single point of failure. |
| More complex to manage because it involves distributed systems. | Easier to manage since it uses a single machine. |
| Suitable for applications requiring massive scalability. | Suitable for applications with moderate scalability needs. |
| Requires load balancing to distribute traffic across servers. | Load balancing is usually not required. |
| Relies on network communication between multiple machines. | Mostly uses communication within a single machine. |

## **Choosing Between Horizontal and Vertical Scaling**

There will be always some trade-offs so it may be a little bit trickier for developers to decide which one is better for an application.

- Firstly, you should identify your requirements, business goals, and areas where we would like to add value.
- Then make important design decisions by questioning ourselves, developing prototypes, and refining the design.
- Most of the time in big organizations engineers take some good qualities of vertical scaling and some good qualities of horizontal scaling.
- They follow a hybrid approach of combining the speed and consistency of vertical scaling, with the resilience and infinite scalability of horizontal scaling.
